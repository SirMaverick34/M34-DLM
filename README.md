# M34 Download Manager
Joshua Velez (SirMaverick34), 2019

## About
The M34 Download Manager is a helpful tool that allows users to access useful content and resources used within the community. Features include a concentrated downloads area for popular content sets, links to resources, and guides that users can follow to expand their NoLimits 2 knowledge. The tool is still development and I take no warranty of its usefulness in its current state (see License information below).

#### Features!
  - Single .exe file! No installation required!
  - Access to Ride, Scenery, Custom Car, and other sets.
  - Ability to add downloaded sets into a specific folder.
  - Access to NL2 Resources like programs and communities.
  - Access to Tutorial Guides (Still a work-in-progress).

#### Known Issues
  - The app will not notify the user after successfully adding a set to the folder.
  - 'Windows Smart Screen' **WILL** activate as a safety precaution. This is a Windows security precaution.
  - Placeholder images still may be in use for items in both Content Sets and Resources Tab.
